connection from san Joaquin to national internet is slow
todo:
change to free bcm
move computing node to vm 
 
 
10:10 humberto
big picture: 4.5TB file
simple picture access protocol

11：40
nanyao what it means for data center is ready?
Including more data from paranal;
 
Zhong: first vo provid alma data;
do we provide something  unique?
Fast than ARC
In  addition to standard VO
Preview before downloading
If we can has the data published 
Security issue
Need for improvement in long term
Internet connection
Connection is not bottlenet for now
Bandwidth restriction: experts and amateur
Risk of going down
Electricity
Update lustre
Lustre is too old and not security
Security public IP：for website it is difficult
CASA for each user is independent
TODO: casa multi-version not independent.
Update data automatically

what kind of job use MPI
alma is different for each project.
Jinhua: Python vs other language
Use the same library under the wrapper
16:10 leizhu
where to get fist
qa2 check fits
disadvantage: 
dependent on science goal
quanlity 
cycle0 & 1
meaningful for cycle0 and 1
far from enough
cycle 2 & 3
enough
nanyao & araya
how to show stamp image
show central image 
compress image
zooming to the center is risky
select peak position
nanyao & lei
we don’t need asdm, only icon and fits, use fits to generate iconic image
jinhua & lei & nanyao
jcmt database is also very simple
lei and nanyao
alma has more parameter, but iconic image is only a image not providing information
araya and nanyao
using fit not asdm metadata, fits is much easier
eachi science goal each project display the icon image
source related paper
araya & lei
calibrated uv-fits is good to provide
uvfits linked with fits and asdm

basic communication to users
shot in faculty
zhong:
     faq more useful than help desk
expert level service: 3d/ reproduce data
data reproducing cookbook/scripts
araya & jinhua…
process time from log
log can provide some information
process time is linear to size or not
 
17:30:round table
zhong: what should I  do to reproduce data
nanayao: download asdm file, run the script, calibrated data reproduce fits.
Mauricio: run pipeline in jupyter, you may modify original pipeline script.
 
Produce uvfits is a primary value-added 
Provide imaging script which will be run in jupyter. 
Lei: why should we do imaging.
Nanyao: we would provide a comment..That is the key part we will provide.
LSST will also use jupyter.
