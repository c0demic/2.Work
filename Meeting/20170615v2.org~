- data process
  - access through vpn(jupyter)
  - jupyter hub through docker
  - lack of astromer testing jupyter
- direct hpc computing
  - simulation
  - need to program with C
  - software are provided by Huawei and might be changed further
- Jovial
  - no public IP, through vpn, need account
  - HPC is not supported through GUI
  - quota can be imposed through BCM
- one more IP address
  - for service not public needed
- VM

- Data
  - 4.5TB data available
  - ADQL similar to SQL
  - first VO to deal with big data like ALMA
  - only qa data(fits) and adsm file,
  - metadata is about 1% of the total meta data extract asdm 
- lustre
  - we need to update lustre, if we update the lustre, the website would be down for 2 weeks

    - can't get connection with Huawei people in China
    - no more info from intel after they ask the log
- casa install

  - no need to run casa on cluster if you don't run MPI, only the memory is large but if there are more people the memory is also low
  - GUI can not work if network speed is slow    

** CASSACA and ChiVO:
- CASSACA is more customized, ChiVO is like that
- ChiVO can provide the alma data, CASSACA is not authorized, CASSACA need to ask permissions
- ? Can Cassaca host other data that ChiVO host(gemini or other things)
- official name for chile-china astronomy data center and logo
 
** Service:
- character: much faster for south american astronomy community
- provide btter stamp image
  - 3D
  - better than compressed icon image?
- uvfits file
  - as an index of asdm and fits?
- jovial (service)
  - not a library, not a GUI(aladin or topcat...)
  - jupyter extention
  - jupyter hub
  - you can repeat the procedure with the paper
    - starlink
    - astropy
    - casa
  - library
    - acalib
    - ...
- help for users/astronmers
  - normal service
    - help desk or faq
  - expert service
    - 3d/ reproduce data
- log information

** Security and network Issue
- security
  - virus?
  - hack?
    - port attack
    - from china
