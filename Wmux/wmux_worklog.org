** magit					  :auxiliaryWork:emacs:magit:
Manage to use magit in emacs to accelerate the speed of orgnizing my worklog
** wmux								  :idea:wmux:
The wmux is short for Web mux, kind of feeling like tmux. It means I hope the web can be split into several different workspace as user expects.
** DONE add account					    :cluster:account:
The account can not be added because my account on datacenter is not in the sudoers file and i can't run cmgui.
- I add 2 accounts:
  - dominik schleicher: pwd: 123456
  - jinhua he: pwd: 123456
The users will be the one who will make simulations on the cluster.
** TODO lustre file not mounted				    :cluster:problem:
